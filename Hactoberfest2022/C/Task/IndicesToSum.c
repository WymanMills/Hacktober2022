// We are given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add upto target.

//You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

//Input:
//First line consists of array of integers
//Second line consists of target integer

//Output:
//Contains the required indices in any order

//Sample 
//Input: nums= {5,2,4}, target = 6
//Output: [1,2]
