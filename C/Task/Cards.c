//There are N cards on a table, out of which X cards are face-up and the remaining are face-down.

//In one operation, you can do the following:
//Select any one card and flip it (i.e. if it was initially face-up, after the operation, it will be face-down and vice versa)
//What is the minimum number of operations we must perform so that all the cards face in the same direction (i.e. either all are face-up or all are face-down)?

//Input:
//The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. 
//Each test case contains two space-separated integers N and X — the total number of cards and the number of cards which are initially face-up.

//Output Format
//For each test case, output the minimum number of cards you must flip so that all the cards face in the same direction.

//Sample:
//Input:
//2
//5 0
//4 2

//Output:
//0
//2
