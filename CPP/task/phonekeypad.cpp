/*Take as input str, a string. str represents keys pressed on a nokia phone keypad. We are concerned with all possible words that can be written with the pressed keys.

Assume the following alphabets on the keys: 1 -> abc , 2 -> def , 3 -> ghi , 4 -> jkl , 5 -> mno , 6 -> pqrs , 7 -> tuv , 8 -> wx , 9 -> yz

E.g. “12” can produce following words “ad”, “ae”, “af”, “bd”, “be”, “bf”, “cd”, “ce”, “cf”

a. Write a recursive function which returns the count of words for a given keypad string. Print the value returned.

b.Write a recursive function which prints all possible words for a given keypad string (void is the return type for function).*/

//input
// 12
//output
/*ad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf
